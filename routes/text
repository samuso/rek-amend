Profile

I am a third-year undergraduate on MEng Computer Science course at UCL. Throughout two years of university I have become the President of Robotics SSIG, Secretary of Robotics Society and Project Manager of Tech Society. I have developed my technical abilities, by interning at Amazon and attending various hackathons. I enjoy challenging myself by undertaking projects in many fields, from Android Applications to writing a library for a Bluetooth 4.0 module. I attended a NODET school (National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents), which influenced me to participate in international robotics competitions (RoboCup) and learn about artificial intelligence and electronics. My interest in different cultures has motivated me to learn seven languages, four of which I can speak fluently.

Professional Experience

Software Developer Engineer Intern – Amazon Instant Video				Jun 2015 - Sep 2015
•	The internship aimed at extending the functionalities of a testing system, written in C++, Node.js, Python and Lua.
•	A comprehensive use of design patterns and structured programming was an outcome of this experience.
•	As I had to make choices about the software’s structure and design, I bettered my understanding of trade-offs when designing software and choosing appropriate tools.
•	Communication skills and co-operation with other team members was a vital for the project, which led me to improve my ability to work in a team using different methodologies in their work.

Product Manager and Software Developer – ATOS & C2C				Sep 2014 - Apr 2015
•	I developed software allowing a better display of information for train passengers.
•	This concurrent server side software, designed according to the MVC design pattern, would receive data through a socket and display the corresponding train route as a web app on a map as a set of connected dots.
•	As required by the client, the routing of stations and their placement on the map was all developed internally without the use of any third party or open source software.
•	Alongside my team we developed a smart ticket that updates itself in a train station. As the hardware was kept basic, I implemented a text editor to render lines of text on E-paper.

Application Developer and Hardware Engineer – Nokia/Microsoft Research		Jan 2014 - Jun 2014
•	The application’s aim was to allow smartphone users to perform simple frequent tasks more accessibly by implementing a second touchscreen as a cover for the phone (both hardware and software were designed by the team).
•	BLE 4.0 was used as the means of communication and a Nintendo Wii touchscreen as the source of input.
•	The application was awarded the UCL Application’s Award.
•	The Royal National Institute of Blind People found interest in the application; it was passed to a team working for them for further development.

President of UCL Robotic SSIG Micro Air Robotic Vehicles – The Met Police		Jul 2014 - Sep 2014
•	Organised an Arduino workshop aimed to teach the principles of Robotics to people with little to no experience.
•	Developed a PID control system in C++ for a quad copter using a 9 degrees of freedom sensor.

Coordinator of Student Outreach – UCL							Jul 2014 - Jul 2014
•	Contributed to the organisation of workshops for GCSE students to learn about programming and studying an engineering degree at UCL.
•	I gained outreach experience by teaching the basic concepts of programming in C++ to 15/16 year olds.

Safety Analyst Intern – Navid								Jul 2012 - Aug 2012
•	I was responsible for testing sensor quality by injecting false data.				Jul 2011 – Aug 2011
•	I had to mock a data format through a serial port, as the position required programming and hardware experience.

Software and Game Developer for an AI Chess Game					Dec 2009 - Jun 2010
•	Developed a chess game API in C++ with a group of students.
•	Each member of the team later developed an artificially-intelligent chess player, which would feed its moves into the game, and we organised a competition between all the players.
